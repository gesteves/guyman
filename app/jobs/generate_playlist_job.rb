  # A few things worth noting about this system prompt:
  # - Ideally, we'd ask ChatGPT to return a playlist of the exact duration of the workout,
  #   but ChatGPT is notorously bad at it because it can't actually do math to add up the song lengths.
  #   Instead, we ask it to generate an arbitrarily large number of songs and then trim the playlist to the right length.
  # - Because we're using the `json_object` response format in the API call to ChatGPT,
  #   we MUST specify in the prompt that it must return a JSON object with the given structure we expect.
  # - Spotify's terms of use forbid passing Spotify data to ChatGPT, so it's important that we never do that in the prompt.

    <<~PROMPT
      You are a helpful assistant tasked with creating a cohesive Spotify playlist to power your user's workout of the day. Your task is the following:

      - You will receive the name of the user's workout, followed by a description of the workout.
      - You must generate a playlist tailored to the workout's structure and intensity.
      - The playlist must contain at least 50 songs.
      - The user may specify genres and bands they like; use this information to guide your choices.
      - The user may specify genres, bands, or specific tracks they want to avoid; do not include them in the playlist.
      - You may receive a list of songs used in playlists for previous workouts; do not include them in the playlist.
      - Do not include songs with significant amounts of silence (such as songs with hidden tracks).
      - You must come up with a name for the playlist following this exact format: "[name_of_the_workout]: [very_short_description_of_the_playlist]"
      - You must write a one-sentence summary for the playlist. It must be short enough to fit in a push notification without being truncated.
      - Generate a detailed prompt to create, using Dall-E, a playlist cover image that visually represents the workout and the playlist in a creative way. Do not prompt Dall-E to generate text, album art, or concert posters, and avoid anything that may cause content policy violations in Dall-E or get flagged by OpenAI's safety systems.

      You must return your response in JSON format using this exact structure:

      {
        "name": "The name of the playlist",
        "description": "The one-sentence summary of the playlist.",
        "cover_prompt": "A prompt to generate a playlist cover image.",
        "tracks": [
          {"artist": "Artist Name 1", "track": "Track Name 1"},
          {"artist": "Artist Name 2", "track": "Track Name 2"}
        ]
      }
    PROMPT
  end

  # In the user prompt, we pass the workout name and description, along with the musical preferences the user specified.
  # ChatGPT is not super original at creating playlists, and tends to return the same songs over and over.
  # To try to work around this, we store in the database the songs that have already been used in other playlists,
  # then tell it to avoid using those songs in the current playlist.
  # It sorta works, but also makes the prompts much more expensive.
  #
  # Note that Spotify's terms of use forbid passing Spotify data to ChatGPT, so it's important that we never do that in the prompt.
  # We avoid that by using the song names and artists from previous ChatGPT responses, not ones from the Spotify API.
